<h2> Unnamed RPG </h2>
<hr>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I built this game for my Game Design Class at CSUSB during Fall Semester 2020. Initially I had a partner, and I soon found out that he was completly unreliable so that partnership ended soon after it started. This is by far the largest project I have ever done, as a group or otherwise. I went into this class completely blind and didn't know anything about game design before I started this class.</p>
<p>In the beginning I followed a youtube tutorial to teach me the basics (I will link the series and the source of the art below), but I quickly went off on my own once I felt I had the basics down. The tutorial was focused on making an 8-Bit Zelda clone, and I wanted to make a turn-based role playing game similar to that of Pokemon or Final Fantasy. </p> 
<h3>Implementations</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>Colliders to control: room changes, dialog triggers, scene changes, calculating random encounter chance, and more</li>
  <li>Multiple Scenes triggered by colliders and by dialog</li>
  <li>Room changes controlled by colliders which changed camera bounds to emulate classic zelda room changes</li>
  <li>Singletons to keep track of objects before and after room changes</li>
  <li>Canvas elements to handle player menu (experience, stats, inventory, etc), dialog and more</li>
  <li>Universal 2d lighting to do interesting lighting effects</li>
  <li>Player Preferences to handle saving and player stats and if certain events had occured</li>
  <li>Loads more that I am certainly forgetting!</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
  
<p>Ultimately this game was a big learning experience for me. If I could go back and start from scratch I would certainly design the game first, then research how to develope each mechanic and lastly begin building the game itself. Part of me wants to go back and improve it but I've decided I will let this game stay the way it is for a few reasons. One, I don't have the time it deserves, and two I would rather spend what time I do have developing a game from scratch instead of spending most of my limited time fixing previous mistakes</p>
